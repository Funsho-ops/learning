## Purpose

Welcome, All!
Our mission is very simple -  Learn Cloud Computing and get a Job.
We are going to be very direct and practical.
We don't need to learn everything, we learn the fundamentals, get our hands dirty doing tasks, get certs and prepare for interviews.

I have done these with a couple of FAF and I'm happy to apply the same strategies to guide us all but ultimately, the obligation for success lies with YOU..

## Features

What are these features? You should see the {% include doc.html name="Getting Started" path="getting-started" %}
guide for a complete summary. Briefly:

 -*User interaction* including consistent permalinks, links to ask questions via GitHub issues, and edit the file on GitHub directly.
 -*Search* across posts, documentation, and other site pages, with an ability to exclude from search.
 -*External Search* meaning an ability to link any page tag to trigger an external search.
 -*Documentation* A documentation collection that was easy to organize on the filesystem, render with nested headings for the user, and refer to in markdown.
 -*Pages* A separate folder for more traditional pages (e.g, about).
 -*Navigation*: Control over the main navigation on the left of the page, and automatic generation of table of contents for each page on the right.
 -*News* A posts feed for news and updates, along with an archive (organized by year).
 -*Templates* or specifically, "includes" that make it easy to create an alert, documentation link, or other content.
 -*Continuous Integration* recipes to preview the site
